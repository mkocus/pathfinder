INSERT INTO region VALUES (10001000, '2023-11-11 16:37:40', '2023-11-11 16:37:40', 'Yasna Zakh', 'Centuries ago a major void between the stars of the New Eden cluster was discovered by Amarr explorers pursuing the cause of their Empire\'s expansion through the cluster. This void was named \"Yasna Zakh\", meaning \"Edge of Devotion\", to express the idea that this was created by God as a limit on the reach of the Amarr\'s own drive to \"reclaim\" the stars. Over time, the meaning shifted and this gap is usually known as \"Divinity\'s Edge\" in common parlance. <br><br>For many years the Yasna Zakh void was thought to mark the edge of the cluster but was eventually recognised as a major feature of the internal structure of New Eden, effectively bisecting the cluster almost in half. The major passage through the Providence and Catch regions to the eastern cluster is conventionally credited to later Amarr explorers but a number of the routes, and in particular the narrow bridge between Molden Heath and the Great Wildlands are thought to be the discoveries of Thukker Tribe nomads and other Minmatar. <br><br>Latterly, the rediscovery of the star system Zarzakh orbiting close by the small black hole known as \"Point of No Return\" has renewed interest in this desolate region of space. The Amarr name for the black hole is \"Duzna Kah\", meaning \"Fallen Beyond Hope\", and this terminology appears to be used by the controlling Deathless Circle. Given the notable antipathy of the Deathless to the Amarr and their religion, this may be a mockingly ironic choice on the part of the enigmatic leader of the Circle.');
